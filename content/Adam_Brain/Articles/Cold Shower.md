## When to take a cold Shower?

I have devised a perfect strategic time to take a cold shower.
Now let me make one thing clear, Do not take cold shower right after you wake up, I'll tell you the reason by explaining my routine -

1. I wake up at least 2 hour before I have to go somewhere ( like office )
2. After I am fully awake I pick a topic to learn which can be related to work or for self improvement. (example - learning Japanese)
3. After this you take a cold Shower, this helps you in two ways - firstly you get all the health benefits and brain benefits that are associated with it and the second bonus benefit is that this helps you solidify or cement your intellectual learning that you did right before it.
4. Andrew Huberman (famous Neuro Scientist) has also pointed out to this benefit. Cold shower after learning a new skill helps brain solidify the new learnings.
5. After this go out with an energised brain to conquer your day.

Pick a new skill just to test out this technique.
I would suggest you to pick out an intellectual skill, for example - learning about stocks, learning a new language, learning how to code, learning statistics/maths etc.

Use this strategy and share your results, I am sure you're going to see immediate results in just two weeks
