**Assets** : to be protected (digital or physical)

**Access Control (AC)** : Selective Restriction of users on platform/software

**Authentication** : Proving individual is who they claim they are. Methods - username & pass, [[2fa (two factor Auth) codes]]

**Antivirus** : Software that remove malicious software from machine. Detection methods - [[signature detection]], [[AI or pattern recognition]]

**Botnet** : Collection of computers infected by malicious software in order to run commands given to them by attacker from control centre.

**Black Hat** : hacker with malicious intent ( for personal gain)

**Cryptography** : Mathematical processes to to protect information and provide with - Confidentiality, Authentication, Integrity.

**CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposure)** : Publicly disclosed security issues

**[[DDOS]]** : Distributed Denial of Service [[Cyber attack]] - for flooding the connection in order to hog the resources

**Digital Certificate** : Proving the identity through a third party entity which is set to be the certificate authority.

**Digital Forensics** : branch of forensic science encompassing the recovery, investigation, examination and analysis of material
found in digital devices, often in relation to mobile devices and computer crime

**DLP (Data Loss Prevention)** : collection of security strategies used to prevent the occurrence of data loss and data leakage

**Encoding**: Converting cleartext to ciphertext


**Firewall** : A tool used for security which can be both a hardware and a software tool, used for filtering traffic. A firewall is controlled by a set of rules which determine which traffic will be let through and which traffic will be blocked. There are different types of firewalls
such as Host based or Network Based firewalls.

**Honeypot** : A purposefully vulnerable system used for trapping Black Hat Hackers.

**IDS (Intrusion Detection System), IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)** : 
IDS: system that detects suspicious activities and generates alerts when they are detected

IPS: Security tool used to constantly monitor the network for malicious activity and once discovering malicious activity, takes the action to block and prevent it

**Malware** : Malicious software or Malware is code written with an intent to cause harm and violate the security of a system. There are many types of Malware: RATs, Keyloggers, Trojans,
Rootkits, Backdoors, Adwares.

**Packet Sniffing** : Collecting/Capturing packets off of a data network communication.

**Sandboxing** : act of isolating a system or an application in order to perform testing

**Social Engineering** : Social engineering is the term used for a broad range of malicious activities accomplished through human interactions. Social Engineering is used in one of the
biggest threats on the internet: Phishing Attacks.

**VPN**: Virtual Private Network is a communication link between systems which is encrypted in order to provide a more secure and private communication.

**Cyber Security Reports** : Reports are a necessary, and important, part of cybersecurity. Writing reports will differ depending on several factors such as the scope of your analysis, the organization
structure, the important assets that need to be secured. Here are some common tips and a [[Cyber Security Report Format]]

**Cyber Security tools** : 
1. **Wireshark**: Wireshark is free and open source packet analyzer. Wireshark is the most often-used packet sniffer in the world.
2. **Tcpdump**: Tcpdump is a useful packet sniffing tool for networks. It helps in monitoring and logging TCP/IP traffic that is shared over a network. Tcpdump is preinstalled on most Linux systems and can be ran from terminal.
3. **Nessus**: Nessus is one of the best vulnerability assessment scanners out there. Nessus offers 3 different versions: Essentials, Professional and Expert.
4. **Metasploit** - Metasploit has an excellent collection of tools that are perfect for penetration testing. It is often used to meet a range of security objectives, such as discovering vulnerabilities of systems and networks, designing strategies to improve the companyâ€™s Cyber Security defence.
5. **Burpsuite** - Burpsuite is used for performing security testing for web applications. It offers many functions from simple proxy functionality to different scanners, intruders to even more advance options such as spider, repeater, and decoder.
6. **Nmap** - Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open source tool used for network scanning and security Auditing. It offers many different options from running basic port scans to running more advance software versions and operating system scans. It can also be used as vulnerability scanner with the help of scripts.
7. **Aircrack-ng** - Aircrack-ng is a complete suite of tools to assess WiFi network security. Several things can be performed with aircrack from monitoring to attacking and cracking the password of the access point
