### What is Docker Image?
A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. It is static in nature. When we run an image its called a [[Container]]

### What is Docker Registry
Docker Registry is a centralized location for storing and distributing Docker images. The most commonly used public registry is Docker Hub, but you can also create your own private registry.

**Docker Tag** - is used to maintain version of the build to push image to Dockerhub.
